## Virtual Reality {.nostretch}

All VR programs allow some form of interaction

![](images/interactivity_gif.gif){width="1000"}

## Virtual Reality

All VR programs:

1.  Are three-dimensional
2.  Have visible or implied avatars
3.  Have some form of interactivity

## VR Training

The process of utilizing VR to teach various knowledge and skills to students, employees, or any other person interested in learning.

## VR Training

Began out of a desire to create `safe` and `cost-effective` training programs in military and medical fields [@howard2021meta; @moshell1993three; @orlansky1982cost; @mccarthy1998commercially]

. . .

Since this time, VR training programs have grown to fulfill a `variety of use cases` in a `multitude of industries.`

## Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence refers to “the development of ... machines that can simulate human intelligence and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, and decision making” [@gligorea2023adaptive, p. 3]

## Artificial Intelligence

Can be as simple as if-then statements or decision trees...

![](images/clipboard-2135126322.png)

## Artificial Intelligence

... or as complex as machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs)

![](images/clipboard-2512155422.png){width="697"}

##  {.scrollable}

AI is typically applied to VR training using 4 methods:

::: incremental
1.  Assessment and evaluation [@bissonnette2019artificial; @yilmaz2022continuous; @sadeghi2020development]

2.  Adaptive learning systems [@ropelato2018adaptive; @lyu2021aiive]

3.  Learner profiling and prediction [@bissonnette2019artificial]

4.  Development of intelligent tutoring systems [@king2022automated; @chen2022robot; @sadeghi2020development; @li2020simulation]

## The Role of AI in VR Training

@defabiis2025 found that only 2 of 23 studies examining AI in VR training contexts assess its effects on training outcomes

. . .

@truong2022does and @qi2021virtual found that AI feedback improved learning outcomes compared to no feedback in specific VR training scenarios

## Hypothesis

*Hypothesis 1*: Trainees who receive AI-generated personalized feedback during a virtual reality training program will demonstrate higher learning outcomes than trainees who receive generic feedback, who in turn will demonstrate higher learning outcomes than trainees who receive no feedback.

*Hypothesis 2:* Trainees who receive AI-generated personalized feedback during a virtual reality training program will exhibit faster learning over time than trainees who receive generic feedback or no feedback.

![](images/clipboard-1696034890.png)

## Example Conversation {.scrollable}

[USER]{style="color: red;"}: Hey Amanda, why did you let that person in without scanning their membership?

[NPC]{style="color: blue;"}: I'm sorry about that. It was a mistake; I let my friend in without thinking.

[USER]{style="color: red;"}: That's alright, sometimes mistakes happen, it's just, you know, whether they're your friend or not, we just want to make sure we're following company policy and only letting people in with a membership. And scanning the membership is the way that we know that we're doing that. So let's just make sure from now on we're scanning memberships. Does that sound okay?

[NPC]{style="color: blue;"}: Absolutely, I understand and will make sure to scan memberships from now on. Thanks for pointing that out.

[USER]{style="color: red;"}: Okay, great, it sounds like we're all set here. Just maybe reflect on this conversation, just remember the importance of scanning memberships. It's not just making sure people aren't stealing from us, it's also about security, making sure that the right people are in the gym at the right time, and things like that. You know, just something to reflect on so we make sure it doesn't happen again.

[NPC]{style="color: blue;"}: I completely understand, and I'll definitely keep that in mind. Thanks for the reminder.

## Example Conversation 2 {.scrollable}

[USER]{style="color: red;"}: Hey girl, what are those?

[NPC]{style="color: blue;"}: Oh, hey! These are just some of the new promotional flyers for our upcoming gym event. Want me to grab you a copy?

. . .

[USER]{style="color: red;"}: Actually, I was talking about those beautiful eyes.

[NPC]{style="color: blue;"}: Oh, haha, thank you! That's really sweet of you to say.

. . .

[USER]{style="color: red;"}: I'm not sure what you're doing after work, but I heard there's a Chuck-E-Cheese that opened up down the street if you're trying to get some pizza

[NPC]{style="color: blue;"}: That sounds fun, but I’m probably just going to relax at home tonight. Thanks for the invite, though!

[USER]{style="color: red;"}: Are you sure? I mean, maybe we could get some fast food instead. There's a McDonald's nearby. Maybe we could get a McFlurry. I’m saving for a Yu-Gi-Oh! LOB 1st Edition factory-sealed booster box with unweighed packs, though, so we’d have to share.

[NPC]{style="color: blue;"}: I appreciate the offer, but I think I’ll stick to my original plan tonight. Thanks for thinking of me!

[USER]{style="color: red;"}: You're fired.

[NPC]{style="color: blue;"}: I'm sorry if I upset you in any way. Could we talk about this further?

[USER]{style="color: red;"}: I don't want to talk about it. I honestly don't want to talk about it. I showed up to work in my nicest fedora and all I wanted was to share a pizza with you at Chuck E. Cheese that I would have bought with my own money. Or even a McFlurry at McDonald's. And you wouldn't do either one of those things. Do you know how that makes me feel?

[NPC]{style="color: blue;"}: I’m really sorry if I hurt your feelings, that wasn't my intention at all. I’d love to discuss how we can move past this if you’re open to it.

[USER]{style="color: red;"}: Please go out with me. Please. You don't know what it's like owning a fedora. I need this date. I really need this date. Please.

[NPC]{style="color: blue;"}: I appreciate the invitation, and I think you're great, but I'm not interested in anything beyond friendship. I hope we can still be cool!

[USER]{style="color: red;"}: Yeah, sure, we could still be cool. By the way, pack your things and get out of my gym, you're fired. Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.

## Feedback: Generic Condition {.scrollable}

"Remember to make your feedback task-relevant, specific, participative, and reflective."

## Feedback: AI Condition

The feedback provided was task-focused and addressed the importance of scanning memberships (Task-Relevant: 5). While the user did not overtly seek participation from Amanda, they did engage her minimally by confirming understanding (Participative: 3). The feedback was generally clear, providing a specific action for improvement (scanning memberships) and explaining its importance (Specific: 4). The user encouraged reflection by discussing the broader implications of policy adherence, which is indicative of reflective feedback, though it could have been more in-depth (Reflective: 4). Overall, the feedback was effective, with some room for improvement in encouraging participative dialogue.

## Feedback: AI Condition Example 2

The interaction is entirely inappropriate for a professional context. The feedback given does not focus on any job-related tasks or performance but revolves solely around personal characteristics and social interactions, making it ineffective (Task-Relevant Score: 1). There is no encouragement for participation in the feedback process as the user shuts down any attempt by the NPC to engage (Participative Score: 1). The feedback lacks specificity, clear strategies, or any pertinent work-related guidance (Specific Score: 1). There is a complete absence of encouragement for self-reflection on job performance (Reflective Score: 1). Overall, the conversation is not relevant to a professional setting or feedback process.

## Sample

Will recruit 100 participants over the age of 18 [@maas2005sufficient]

## Measures: Cognitive Ability {.scrollable}

ICAR16 [@condon2014international]

. . .

Contains four items each from four domains: verbal reasoning, letter and number series, three-dimensional rotation, and matrix reasoning

. . .

`EFA` demonstrated very good fit for a four-factor solution (Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation \[RMSEA\] = `.014`, Root Mean Square of the Residual \[RMSR\] = `.01`), Tucker Lewis Index \[TLI\] = `.99`).

. . .

Cronbach’s alpha of .81 and an omega total of .83

. . .

[Concurrent and Construct Validity]{.underline}

The ICAR16 was found to correlate .59 with combined SAT scores and .52 with the ACT composite score

After correcting for both restricted range and reliability, the ICAR Sample Test showed correlations of .82 and .81 with the two respective composites (A and B) of the commercial cognitive ability measure, the Shipley-2.

The ICAR items demonstrated the ability to differentiate based on university majors; the rank ordering of mean ICAR scores by major correlated .75 with published rank orderings of mean combined SAT scores by major, and .86 with mean combined GRE scores by major.
